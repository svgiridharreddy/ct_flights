One of the most disappointing experiences was having my Air Pegasus flight canceled on two occasions. The customer service executive was reluctant to transfer me to another airline but found me a flight scheduled for a later date. The overall experience was not ideal, though the on-air and on-ground staff were quite pleasant.  
The seats were a little constricting and my legs were sore by the end of the flight. After a while, it got very stuffy since the plane was filled to capacity. The flight attendants were warm and efficient though and the in-flight services were not terrible. 
Air Pegasus needs to sort out its arrivals and departures, especially the technical issues. Contacting customer service may take longer than expected. The hardworking cabin crew is always welcoming and accommodating.
