I took the Kochi to Delhi flight by Air Asia a few days ago. While the in-flight services is not lacking, it will surely be better if they improve it. The in-flight entertainment needed a larger choice of movies seeing as you’re paying for it, and the airhostesses could be a little less mechanic and more warmer to their passengers.

I have travelled by Air Asia for some time now. Fortunately, I have never faced any problems on the flight. The staff were extremely polite, they even escorted me to my seat. The food served was really good, and the in-flight entertainment ensured that I wouldn’t be bored. The aspect in which this airline shines is its on-schedule arrival and departure.

The service was excellent. The plane was clean and had comfortable seats with ample leg room. The cabin crew were an eager bunch. The food, which we pre-booked, was pretty good too and so was the in-flight entertainment we bought. I would certainly recommend this as a low-cost option to others.

IThis was my first time flying with Air Asia. I was travelling from Delhi to Bengaluru. It was a satisfying experience overall. Even though the flight left a little bit late, it landed at Bengaluru airport on time. The in-flight service was also decent. The food I ordered onboard was very tasty too.
